    <h2>What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h2>
        <p>Temporal dead zone is a area of a block where a variable is inaccessible.</p>

    <h2>What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax?</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, the for-in loop is a basic control statement that allows you to loop through the 
            properties of an object.</p>
            <pre>
                for (key in object) {
                    // body of for...in
                }
            </pre>
    

    <h2>Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript?</h2>
        <p> Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of 
            variables to JavaScript.<br> 
    <b>Local Scope:-</b>        Local variables are those declared inside of a block.<br>
    <b>Block Scope:-</b>        The block scope restricts a variable's access to the block in which it is declared. <br>
    <b>functional Scope:-</b>   When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function 
                                and cannot be used outside that function.<br>
    <b>scope chain:-</b>        When a variable is used in JavaScript, the JavaScript engine will try to find the 
                         variable’s value in the current scope. If it could not find the variable, <br>it will look 
                         into the outer scope and will continue to do so until it finds the variable or reaches 
                         global scope.
        </p>
    

    <h2>What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</h2>
        <p>The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value. The null 
            value is a primitive value that represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference.</p>
    

    <h2>what is Symbol?</h2>
        <p>Symbol is a primitive data type of JavaScript, along with string, number, boolean, null and undefined.
            immutable
        </p>
    

    <h2>Write code to explain map and filter in arrays?</h2>
    <p>Map and filter are all array methods in JavaScript. Each one will iterate over an array and perform a 
        transformation or computation. Each will return a new array based on the result of the function. </p>
    <pre>
        <b>map</b> → Executes a function on each element of an array
        Every element of the array is passed to the callback function and returns a new array with the same length.
        
        const num = [2,3,5,6,4,1,8,4];
        const mappednum =num.map(item => item*2); 
        console.log(mappednum);

        <b>filter</b> → Remove items which don't satisfy a condition
        Every element of the array is passed to the callback function. On each iteration, if the callback returns 
        true, then that element will be added to the new array, otherwise, it is not added to the new array.

        const filternum = num.filter(item => item > 2) 
        console.log(filternum);
    </pre>
    

    <h2>Explain passed by value and passed by reference?</h2>
        <pre>
            <b>Pass by Value:</b>
                            <p>In Pass by Value, Function is called by directly passing the value of the variable 
                                as the argument. Changing the argument inside the function doesn’t affect the 
                                variable passed from outside the function.
                                Works with primitive data types.
                            </p>
            
            <b>Pass by Reference:</b>
                            <p>In Pass by Reference, Function is called by directly passing the reference/address 
                                of the variable as the argument. Changing the argument inside the function affect 
                                the variable passed from outside the function. In Javascript objects and arrays 
                                follows pass by reference.
                                Works with non-primitive data types.
                            </p>
        </pre>

    <h2>Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code?</h2>
        <p>A self-invoking (also called self-executing) function is a nameless (anonymous) function that is invoked 
            immediately after its definition. <br>An anonymous function is enclosed inside a set of parentheses followed 
            by another set of parentheses () , which does the execution.</p>
            IIFE function
        <pre>
            (function(x){
                console.log(x);
            })("Hello, World!");
        </pre>
    
    <h2>What is an event loop and call stack?</h2>
        <b>Event Loop</b><p>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for 
                            executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.</p>

        <b>call stack</b><p>A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) 
                            to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — <br>what function is currently 
                            being run and what functions are called from within that function,</p>
