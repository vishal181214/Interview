    <h2>Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</h2>
    <p>These are just different ways of invoking or calling a function. When you are calling a function using any of these 3 then you</p>
    <p>don't have to define in the function that will be taking object as a parameter.</p>
    <p>It will assume that the first argument which is coming while calling the function will be an object only.</p>
    <p><b>Call:-</b>It invokes the function and allows us to pass arguments one by one.</p>
    <p><b>Apply:-</b>It invokes the function and allows us to pass arguments as an array.</p>
    <p><b>Bind:-</b>It returns a new function, and this new function you can use anytime anywhere.</p>
    <pre>
        let person = {  
            name: "James",
            lname: "Smith",
            hello: function(thing) {
                console.log(this.name +" "+this.lname + " says hello " + thing);
            }
        }

        let one = {
            name: "Joy", 
            lname: "Stuff"
        }

        let two = {
            name:"tom",
            lname:"cruise"
        }

        person.hello("world");                  // output:  James Smith says hello world
        person.hello.call(one, "world");        // output:  Joy Stuff says hello world
        person.hello.apply(one,["sky"]);        // output:  Joy Stuff says hello sky

        let result = person.hello.bind(two);
        result("world");                        //output:  tom cruise says hello Rider
    </pre>

    <h2>What are objects in javascript?</h2>
        <p>Objects are the non-primitive datatypes and are use to store multiple data in the form of key value pairs.</p>
        <p>JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.</p>
        <pre>
            const per = {
                name: 'Sai',
                age: 20
            }
            console.log('I am '+ per.name + 'and i am' + per.age);
        </pre>
    
    <h2>What are function constructors?</h2>
        <p>Function constructor is kind of regular function to create multiple objects at a time. when creating function constructor, it is good practice to keep the first letter of the name, capital.</p>
        <p>new keyword is mandatory to be used with function constructor.</p>
        <p>Calling the constructor directly can create functions dynamically.</p>
        <pre>
            function Person(name, salary){
                this.name = name,
                this.salary = salary
            }
            const PersonOne = new Person('Joy', 50000);
            console.log(PersonOne.name);
        </pre>
    
    <h2>Explain prototypes?</h2>
        <p>Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. 
            Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype.</p>
        <p>The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's 
            called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own 
            prototype.</p>
        <p>When you try to access a property of an object: if the property can't be found in the object 
            itself, the prototype is searched for the property. If the property still can't be found, 
            then the prototype's</p> 
        <p>prototype is searched, and so on until either the property is found, or the end of the chain 
            is reached, in which case undefined is returned.</p>
    
    <h2>What is prototype chain?</h2>
        <p>Every object has a prototype, including the prototype object. This “chain” goes all the way 
            back until it reaches an object that has no prototype, usually Object's prototype.</p>
    
    <h2>Give an example of inheritance using function constructor?</h2>
        <pre>
            function Person(name, course,desi){
                this.name = name;
                this.course = course;
                this.desi = desi;
            }
            
            const PersonInheriated = new Person("Joy","CSE","Student");
            console.log('Name is ' + PersonInheriated.name + ' course is ' + PersonInheriated.course + ' with desigination ' + PersonInheriated.desi);

            // output:- Name is Joy course is CSE with desigination Student
        </pre>

    <h2>What are callbacks?</h2>
        <p> Callback function which is passed as argument to another function. These functions are executed after another function has finished its execution.</p>
        <p><b>Why do we use it:</b> The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response</p>
             <p class="algna">javascript will keep executing while listening for other events Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call and </p>
             <p class="algna">the next function which logs the message.</p>
        <pre>
            function output(callback){
                console.log("out");
                callback()
            }

            function input(){
                console.log("in");
            }
            output(input);
        </pre>
    
    <h2>What is the use of setTimeout?</h2>
        <p>The global setTimeout() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression 'after' a specified 
            number of milliseconds.</p>
        <pre>
            setTimeout(function () {
                console.log("Good Evening");
            }, 2000);
        </pre>
   
    
    <h2>What are pure functions?</h2>
        <p>A function is called pure function if it always returns the same result for same argument values and it has no side effects like modifying an argument or outputting something.</p>
        <p>Pure functions return the same output if we use the same input parameters.</p>
